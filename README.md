# MNIST-Data
Using the KNN algorithm for predicting the label of images of the MNIST data set. The data set has 2 csv files - one meant for training the model and one meant for testing the model. In this I have manually altered the values of the nearest neighbours and found the best value. On the other hand one can create a model, tune the hyper parameters and input the best estimator value into the model.

I have created another python notebook file in which I used decision tree to classify the labels. In this project while using the decision tree, I have tuned the parameters and input the best one. Obviously, in this I am manually entering the best hyper-parameter after finding it through GridSearchCV method. One can improvise this by letting the machine input the best parameters for the model created
